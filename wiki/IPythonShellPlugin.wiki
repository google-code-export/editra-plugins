= Implemented IPython Features =

    * ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
    * %quickref -> Quick reference.
        magic keys support: %bookmark
    * help      -> Python's own help system.

        ex: import smtplib then smtplib?
    * !command  -> Execute command in shell ex: !ls,!dir,!cd
    * TAB       -> Autocompletion

= Planned Features =

    * 1)History reload on startup
    * 2)History widget : a widget that can be edited and that display all commands previously executed.
    * 3)Live help widget : a widget that display help content each time you push a key :) <- hot feature!
    * 4)Script toolbar : a toolbar where button are added from ipython shell to execute scripts :) <- cool feature!

= Known Bugs =
    * Version 0.3:
          * Breaking infinite loop with Alt+c while displaying text can freeze the widget.(Hard to solve)
